storytime
=========

Cycletime Tracker from CREADECORP ALM TOOLS LLC's® Step By Step Agile Metricnomics Toolkit

By using CREADECORP's proprietary COMMITINTENT commit message format ( PROJECTNAME-STORYNUMBER [PAIR NAME, PAIR NAME] MESSAGE) and always conforming to the same pair names (for NO-ADDED COST SOX COMPLIANCE) storytime will permit you track cycletime for your agile team. Simply:

1. Write a regex that captures each member of a given role
2. Put that regex into storytme where it says `NAME_REGEX`
3. Put the corresponding 3 letter role name in where it says `ROLE`
4. run the following in the repo you wish to track `sh path_to/storytime 301 402` where `301` and `402` are the story numbers that require analyzing. 
5. Receive your results:
